# Active Directory Virtual Home Lab
This GitHub repo is to demonstrate and show my journey on learning Microsoft's **Active Directory** system used in **IT Help Desk** and **Support Roles**. Iâ€™m using **Windows Server 2022** and **Windows 11** virtual machines inside **VirtualBox** to simulate a small business network and practice real-world IT administration skills.


## Network Diagram

Here is a visualization of what is happening in this Active Directory home lab and the connections between the Domain Controller to the Windows Client Machine
